This is your job - Generate rows for a .csv file dataset about ICD diseases in the range A00-A99. 
It will be used to train an A.I. to predict a disease from given features, with the obvious aim of achieving high accuracy, precision and recall.
This is the structure I want: 
Feature 1 - Geography, where the disease mainly resides (string) - give a general area where it is prominent - as an example, if the infection is prominent in mostly part of America [continent] state "Americas" instead of "Americas (Ohio, Michigan, Mexico", for example; 
Feature 2 - How the disease transmits (a mini-list comprising 3 strings) - should only be key words, for example use "waterbone" instead of "spread through water"
Feature 3 - Disease type, would be bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal (string); 
Feature 4 - 6 most common associated symptoms with disease (list containing 6 strings in between); 
Label - Disease Name; 
Additional column - ICD code 
I want these 6 columns for every row, with each row mapping to A00, A01... A99 (Should be 100 rows unless certain ICD codes aren't used - in that case, omit those unused codes and use less rows).
Don't make code for creating the actual database, just make the 100 or so rows. Leave the database creation to me.
Take it slowly, prioritise accuracy over speed. I can wait.
