This is your job - Generate a 100 row .csv file dataset about ICD diseases in the range A00-A99. 
It will be used to train an A.I. to predict a disease from given features, with the obvious aim of achieving high accuracy, precision and recall.
This is the structure I want: 
Feature 1 - Geography, where the disease mainly resides (string) - if it is general like "Global", just put "Global", no need for explanation; 
Feature 2 - How the disease transmits (string) - should only be key words, for example use "waterbone" instead of "spread through water"
Feature 3 - Disease type, would be bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal (string); 
Feature 4 - 6 most common associated symptoms with disease (List of 6 elements); 
Label - Disease Name; 
Additional column - ICD code I want these 6 columns for every row, with each row mapping to A00, A01... A99 (Should be 100 rows unless certain ICD codes aren't used - in that case, just use less rows).
Take it slowly, prioritise accuracy over speed. I can wait.
