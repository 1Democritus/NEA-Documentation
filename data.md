As every major ilness group has the same set of symptoms, and the dished out treatment for the different conditions are usually distributed by the same doctor, I will group these ilnesses with these major groups, not individually; will change this of Erdal abi didn't actually mean this, because right now he's implying I should use subgroups; this makes give or take 220 rows, which is still way more manageable than every individual condition

| Symptom | Symptom | Symptom | Symptom | Symptom | Symptom | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
