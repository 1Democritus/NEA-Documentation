ANALYSIS for pdf:
For my NEA project, I have decided to have a web-implemented chatbot that would take user symptoms as input, return the doctor responsible for the respective treatment, and use a normalised SQL database to find their next free appointment. Everyday, there are many patients who believe they have a disease or condition due to experiencing some symptoms, or just want to have a basic checkup, who as a next course of action contact the local hospital to receive the respective treatment, prescription or check. In the United Kingdom, this is a complicated, convoluted process, requiring many phone calls, multiple doctor's appointments based on the circumstance, and potentially being on a waiting list for years! I've recently experienced this first hand; possible symptoms and intending to check for a serious condition led to phone calls, multiple appointments, and more than a month of waiting for the checkup I needed. The checkup place I was given was hours away when there was one in the city... I would still consider myself lucky that I only waited months and not years!

My project intends to smooth this process; if you have symptoms of an unknown reason, the chatbot will significantly shorten the process of figuring out what condition it links to; if it does or could link to a condition, the database will allow for quick and efficient scheduling of an appointment with the doctor who manages the subject, which the normalised SQL will be able to find quickly. It will not only be better for the customers but also for the NHS workers, who won't have to exhaust themselves trying to find the required doctor; the database will do it for them.

My key user is an NHS worker, working there would give him a good idea of the British Health system and its problems. My end users can be anyone desiring to schedule a health-related appointment; my project would give them immediate access to communication and instant scheduling instead of waiting in a long queue for a phone call and then an indefinite waiting list.
