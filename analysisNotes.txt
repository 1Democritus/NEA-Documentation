How does the hospital you are familiar with schedule appointments?
The foundation of patient management in the NHS is the Patient Administration System (PAS). When a patient requires an appointment, either through a direct call or an urgent referral, they must be identified within this system using a combination of key identifiers:

Date of Birth

NHS Number (the universal identifier)

A hospital-specific number (which varies between Trusts)

Once identified, the PAS links the patient to three essential resources to create a booking: a specific clinician, a physical location (e.g., a room or clinic), and the reason for the appointment. While the underlying software systems, such as Oracle Health (Cerner Millennium), are robust and stable, the complexity arises from how these resources and systems interact at a broader level.

Is it clunky? Is it hard to keep track of?
The issue is not that the appointment-booking software itself is clunky or unstable. The real problems are systemic and can be grouped into two main categories:

Lack of Integration: The devolved structure of the NHS allows different hospital Trusts to choose their own IT providers. This creates a fragmented environment where these disparate systems cannot communicate with each other, making seamless patient data sharing between hospitals a major challenge.

Operational Inefficiency and Waiting Lists: The current crisis with long waiting lists is severely worsened by waste. This waste comes from last-minute cancellations (by the hospital) and patients who do not attend their appointments (DNAs). These are difficult-to-solve "human issues" that squander valuable clinical time and resources.

Does the usage of different software systems by different hospitals make organisation more difficult?
Yes, this makes organisation significantly harder. The core challenge is the difficulty in integrating data to create a single, unified record for a patient who may receive care from multiple hospitals.

This creates a crucial conflict:

For an individual hospital, choosing its own specialised system can seem like the easiest way to make progress.

For the NHS as a whole, this approach is a poor long-term solution because it creates a disconnected digital landscape.

Hospitals typically lack the budget for massive integration projects, forcing them to rely on large, outsourced vendors like Cerner, which creates a dependency on these external providers.

What do you think is its main flaw?
The single greatest flaw in the system is not technical, but operational: the inability to predict and manage patient "no-shows" (also known as 'Did Not Attend' or DNA).

This creates a cascade of negative consequences:

Wasted Resources: It leaves expensive clinicians and fully-equipped rooms idle.

Financial Drain: This inefficiency costs the NHS millions of pounds.

Increased Waiting Times: Every empty slot is a missed opportunity to treat another patient, directly worsening the waiting list crisis.

In essence, the system's main flaw is its lack of predictive and agile scheduling.

Would an A.I. assistant to link symptoms with doctors which give treatments be useful?
Yes, but its history is complex. Early attempts by startups to create "AI doctors" often failed due to technological limitations and flawed business models.

The key difference today is the power of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, trained on vast medical datasets, are far more capable of understanding complex symptoms than their predecessors. This technological leap has renewed confidence that an AI assistant can effectively triage patients and navigate them to the correct resource. The challenge has shifted from "can it be done?" to "how can it be integrated safely and effectively into the NHS pathway?"

Would a normalised database with links between doctors, rooms, and available times be helpful?
While logical, this is considered impractical for a system as complex as the NHS. The reason is that NHS Trusts don't just procure software; they procure long-term, low-risk partnerships with major enterprise providers that offer robust guarantees on:

Implementation & Support

Stability & Security

Performance

A standalone system, even if functionally sound, could not compete with these comprehensive guarantees without significant government backing and a proven track record.

What could you adjust in this system to solve the issues between local clinics and hospitals?
Solving the disconnect between local clinics and hospitals requires a large-scale, centrally-driven strategy built on three pillars, rather than a small application:

Data Unification & Standardisation: Creating a single, shared source of truth for patient medical records that is accessible by both GPs and hospital clinicians.

Guaranteed Performance: The integrated system must be exceptionally robust, reliable, and performant under the immense, critical load of a national health service.

State-of-the-Art Security: Given the high frequency of cyberattacks, the system must be built with uncompromising, multi-layered security to protect patient data and ensure operational continuity.

What accessibility needs would this system need to implement?
Accessibility is a foundational, non-negotiable requirement, particularly for any patient-facing interfaces. Any system must legally comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the AA level.

This means any patient portal or app must be designed to work for people with a wide range of needs, including:

Visual impairments: Compatibility with screen readers and sufficient colour contrast.

Motor impairments: Fully navigable using a keyboard alone.

Cognitive and learning disabilities: Use of clear, simple language and a logical, predictable layout.

Furthermore, any service that hopes to integrate with the official NHS App must pass a rigorous approval process that forces developers to meet these strict accessibility, security, and performance standards.


ANALYSIS for pdf:
For my NEA project, I have decided to have a web-implemented chatbot that would take user symptoms as input, return the doctor responsible for the respective treatment, and use a normalised SQL database to find their next free appointment. Everyday, there are many patients who believe they have a disease or condition due to experiencing some symptoms, or just want to have a basic checkup, who as a next course of action contact the local hospital to receive the respective treatment, prescription or check. In the United Kingdom, this is a complicated, convoluted process, requiring many phone calls, multiple doctor's appointments based on the circumstance, and potentially being on a waiting list for years! I've recently experienced this first hand; possible symptoms and intending to check for a serious condition led to phone calls, multiple appointments, and more than a month of waiting for the checkup I needed. The checkup place I was given was hours away when there was one in the city... I would still consider myself lucky that I only waited months and not years!

My project intends to smooth this process; if you have symptoms of an unknown reason, the chatbot will significantly shorten the process of figuring out what condition it links to; if it does or could link to a condition, the database will allow for quick and efficient scheduling of an appointment with the doctor who manages the subject, which the normalised SQL will be able to find quickly. It will not only be better for the customers but also for the NHS workers, who won't have to exhaust themselves trying to find the required doctor; the database will do it for them.

My key user is an NHS worker, working there would give him a good idea of the British Health system and its problems. My end users can be anyone desiring to schedule a health-related appointment; my project would give them immediate access to communication and instant scheduling instead of waiting in a long queue for a phone call and then an indefinite waiting list.
